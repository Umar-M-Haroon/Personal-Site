shortDescription: Analyzed customer activities of a music hosting service using Spark Dataframe and Spark SQL on a 247.6 MB dataset running on IBM Watson Studio. Built ML Pipeline with Spark ML to predict churn with 0.74 F1 score and 0.8 accuracy
problemStatement: Number of active users is an essential KPI to any service businesses including music hosting service. Therefore, a critical problem for these companies is predicting whether a users will stop using their service and turn to other competitors. Because losing users mean losing advertising revenue and subscription revenue, which are 2 main streams of revenue for the company. 
solution: This project aims to predict churn of a music hosting service (Sparkify) using a 247.6 MB dataset with Python and Spark. A good model of churn prediction is expected to help the company identify users who are prone to leave, then take some preemptive actions (sending promotions, etc.) to hopefully keep them before it's too late.
