service: RealityKit, ARKit, UIKit, SwiftUI

shortDescription: Built an AR INfection Simluator to mimic the spread of COVID-19

challenge: Displaying how highly transmissible infections correlate to large populations can be extremely difficult as we input more variables such as vaccines, resistance and the choice to not take the vaccine, etc.
solution: Create an AR simulator that would show how infectious a disease can be to a connected population
