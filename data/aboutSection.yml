  An iOS engineer who spends his time in the sky

content: >
  I'm an iOS developer that has been working on a variety of iOS apps since 2017, and since been working in the industry after graudating from CU Boulder in 2021. When I'm not working, I'm spending time in a Cessna 172 and trying to fly to new places. I love flying, reading, and playing soccer
